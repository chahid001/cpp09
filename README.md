The C++ Module 09 delves into advanced concepts of the Standard Template Library (STL) through three comprehensive exercises. It emphasizes adhering to C++98 standards while exploring Object-Oriented Programming principles.

The first exercise, "Bitcoin Exchange," requires creating a program to calculate Bitcoin values based on a provided database, focusing on error handling and container usage. The second exercise, "Reverse Polish Notation," involves developing a calculator using RPN, limiting numbers to less than 10 and handling basic operations.

Finally, "PmergeMe" necessitates implementing merge-insert sort algorithms with stringent requirements on container use and sorting large sets of positive integers. Each exercise mandates specific output formats and error handling. Overall, this module demands a firm grasp of STL, error management, and algorithm implementation in C++.
